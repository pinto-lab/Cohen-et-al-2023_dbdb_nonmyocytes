## Abstract

Diabetes is associated with a significantly elevated risk of heart failure. However, despite extensive efforts to characterise the phenotype of the diabetic heart, the molecular and cellular protagonists that underpin cardiac pathological remodelling in diabetes remain unclear, with a notable paucity of data regarding the impact of diabetes on non-myocytes within the heart. Here we aimed to define key differences of cardiac non-myocytes between spontaneously type-2 diabetic (db/db) and healthy (db/h) mouse hearts. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed a concerted diabetes-induced cellular response contributing to cardiac remodelling. These included cell-specific activation of gene programs relating to fibroblast hyperplasia and cell migration, and dysregulation of pathways involving vascular homeostasis and protein folding. This work offers a new perspective for understanding the cellular mediators of diabetes-induced cardiac pathology, and pathways that may be targeted to address the cardiac complications associated with diabetes.
